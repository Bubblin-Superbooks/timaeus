Were they not to be trained in gymnastic, and music, and all other sorts of knowledge which were proper for them?</p><p>TIMAEUS: Very true.</p><p>SOCRATES: And being thus trained they were not to consider gold or silver or anything else to be their own private property; they were to be like hired troops, receiving pay for keeping guard from those who were protected by them&mdash;the pay was to be no more than would suffice for men of simple life; and they were to spend in common, and to live together in the continual practice of virtue, which was to be their sole pursuit.</p></div> </div>
