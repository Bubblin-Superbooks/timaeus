<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> but we cannot imagine an intellectual world which has no qualities&mdash;'a thing in itself'&mdash;a point which has no parts or magnitude, which is nowhere, and nothing.

In what relation does the archetype stand to the Creator himself? For the idea or pattern of the world is not the thought of God, but a separate, self-existent nature, of which creation is the copy. We can only reply, (1) that to the mind of Plato subject and object were not yet distinguished; (2) that he supposes the process of creation to take place in accordance with his own theory of ideas;</p></div> </div>
