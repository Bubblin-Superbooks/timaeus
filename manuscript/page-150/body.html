<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Plato's account of the soul is partly mythical or figurative, and partly literal. Not that either he or we can draw a line between them, or say, 'This is poetry, this is philosophy'; for the transition from the one to the other is imperceptible. Neither must we expect to find in him absolute consistency. He is apt to pass from one level or stage of thought to another without always making it apparent that he is changing his ground. In such passages we have to interpret his meaning by the general spirit of his writings. To reconcile his inconsistencies would be contrary to the first principles of criticism and fatal to any true understanding of him.</p><p>There is a further difficulty in explaining this part of the Timaeus&mdash;the natural order of thought is inverted. We begin with the most abstract, and proceed from the abstract to the concrete.</p></div> </div>
