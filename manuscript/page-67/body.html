<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But as I observed the rule of probability at first, I will begin anew, seeking by the grace of God to observe it still.</p><p>In our former discussion I distinguished two kinds of being&mdash;the unchanging or invisible, and the visible or changing. But now a third kind is required, which I shall call the receptacle or nurse of generation. There is a difficulty in arriving at an exact notion of this third kind, because the four elements themselves are of inexact natures and easily pass into one another, and are too transient to be detained by any one name; wherefore we are compelled to speak of water or fire, not as substances, but as qualities. They may be compared to images made of gold, which are continually assuming new forms. Somebody asks what they are; if you do not know, the safest answer is to reply that they are gold.</p></div> </div>
