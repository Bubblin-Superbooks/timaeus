He could not isolate phenomena, and he was helpless against the influence of any word which had an equivocal or double sense.</p><p>Yet without this crude use of analogy the ancient physical philosopher would have stood still; he could not have made even 'one guess among many' without comparison. The course of natural phenomena would have passed unheeded before his eyes, like fair sights or musical sounds before the eyes and ears of an animal.
