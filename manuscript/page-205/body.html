<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The soul of the world is framed on the analogy of the soul of man, and many traces of anthropomorphism blend with Plato's highest flights of idealism. The heavenly bodies are endowed with thought; the principles of the same and other exist in the universe as well as in the human mind. The soul of man is made out of the remains of the elements which had been used in creating the soul of the world; these remains, however, are diluted to the third degree; by this Plato expresses the measure of the difference between the soul human and divine. The human soul, like the cosmical, is framed before the body, as the mind is before the soul of either&mdash;this is the order of the divine work&mdash;and the finer parts of the body, which are more akin to the soul, such as the spinal marrow, are prior to the bones and flesh.</p></div> </div>
