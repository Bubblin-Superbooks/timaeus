<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Was the heaven then or the world, whether called by this or by any other more appropriate name&mdash;assuming the name, I am asking a question which has to be asked at the beginning of an enquiry about anything&mdash;was the world, I say, always in existence and without beginning? or created, and had it a beginning? Created, I reply, being visible and tangible and having a body, and therefore sensible; and all sensible things are apprehended by opinion and sense and are in a process of creation and created. Now that which is created must, as we affirm, of necessity be created by a cause. But the father and maker of all this universe is past finding out; and even if we found him, to tell of him to all men would be impossible.</p></div> </div>
