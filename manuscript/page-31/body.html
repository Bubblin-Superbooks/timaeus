<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Socrates begins the Timaeus with a summary of the Republic. He lightly touches upon a few points,&mdash;the division of labour and distribution of the citizens into classes, the double nature and training of the guardians, the community of property and of women and children. But he makes no mention of the second education, or of the government of philosophers.</p><p>And now he desires to see the ideal State set in motion; he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle. But he is unable to invent such a narrative himself; and he is afraid that the poets are equally incapable; for, although he pretends to have nothing to say against them, he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators, who can only describe what they have seen.</p></div> </div>
