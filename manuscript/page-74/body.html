And there is a fifth figure (which is made out of twelve pentagons), the dodecahedron&mdash;this God used as a model for the twelvefold division of the Zodiac.</p><p>Let us now assign the geometrical forms to their respective elements. The cube is the most stable of them because resting on a quadrangular plane surface, and composed of isosceles triangles. To the earth then, which is the most stable of bodies and the most easily modelled of them, may be assigned the form of a cube; and the remaining forms to the other elements,&mdash;to fire the pyramid, to air the octahedron, and to water the icosahedron,&mdash;according to their degrees of lightness or heaviness or power, or want of power, of penetration. The single particles of any of the elements are not seen by reason of their smallness; they only become visible when collected.</p></div> </div>
