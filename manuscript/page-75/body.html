<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The ratios of their motions, numbers, and other properties, are ordered by the God, who harmonized them as far as necessity permitted.</p><p>The probable conclusion is as follows:&mdash;Earth, when dissolved by the more penetrating element of fire, whether acting immediately or through the medium of air or water, is decomposed but not transformed. Water, when divided by fire or air, becomes one part fire, and two parts air. A volume of air divided becomes two of fire. On the other hand, when condensed, two volumes of fire make a volume of air; and two and a half parts of air condense into one of water. Any element which is fastened upon by fire is cut by the sharpness of the triangles, until at length, coalescing with the fire, it is at rest; for similars are not affected by similars.</p></div> </div>
