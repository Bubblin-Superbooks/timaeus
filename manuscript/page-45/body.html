<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the likeness of what animal was the world made?&mdash;that is the third question...The form of the perfect animal was a whole, and contained all intelligible beings, and the visible animal, made after the pattern of this, included all visible creatures.</p><p>Are there many worlds or one only?&mdash;that is the fourth question...One only. For if in the original there had been more than one they would have been the parts of a third, which would have been the true pattern of the world; and therefore there is, and will ever be, but one created world. Now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible and tangible,&mdash;visible and therefore made of fire,&mdash;tangible and therefore solid and made of earth. But two terms must be united by a third, which is a mean between them; and had the earth been a surface only, one mean would have sufficed, but two means are required to unite solid bodies.</p></div> </div>
