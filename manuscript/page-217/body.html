<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Plato's account of digestion and the circulation of the blood is closely connected with his theory of respiration. Digestion is supposed to be effected by the action of the internal fire, which in the process of respiration moves into the stomach and minces the food. As the fire returns to its place, it takes with it the minced food or blood; and in this way the veins are replenished. Plato does not enquire how the blood is separated from the faeces.</p><p>Of the anatomy and functions of the body he knew very little,&mdash;e.g. of the uses of the nerves in conveying motion and sensation, which he supposed to be communicated by the bones and veins; he was also ignorant of the distinction between veins and arteries;&mdash;the latter term he applies to the vessels which conduct air from the mouth to the lungs;&mdash;he supposes the lung to be hollow and bloodless;</p></div> </div>
